  <h3>About Git</h3>
  <h4>December 10, 2014</h4>
      <p>
        In this post, I will be recapping some of my learning highlights after completing the majority of Phase 0, Week 1 at Dev Bootcamp. This week, we were introduced to concepts such as version control, git (a version control software - more on that later), and the social code-sharing platform, GitHub. I will start with a brief definition of each of these topics and then explain what they do and why they are so important and useful to programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
Version control is a form of software that enables the user to keep track of earlier versions of their code or project in case something goes wrong in future editions or a bug comes up that requires debugging. The benefits of version control are that the user, along with other collaborators on the project, are able to look back in time at other previous versions of their project if they decide they don't like an aspect of the current version they are working on, or if, after saving the most recent version, they discover that it caused some sort of error to occur in the program. This prevents the developers from having to go back through the entirety of their code to figure out exactly where they went wrong, since they will have saved previous versions that were clear of errors when they saved them. Next, I will discuss one of the most popular version control softwares, git, and the popular site where git can be posted for developers to collaborate or comment on each other's code, GitHub.
</p>
<p>
Git is a version control software that a developer installs locally - on their computer - that they can access through the main device used to tell a computer what to do - the command-line interface (in a Mac, the CLI is Terminal). Git can be set to keep track of changes a user makes to their projects in text editors such as Sublime Text. When a user wishes to institute a change and 'new version' of their project, they simply add and commit the change in git (Committing a change means that the change has been "saved" as a new version). Using the command "git log", the developer can review past changes they have made which can come in handy if a problem comes up in the program at some point. The final topic I will touch on in today's post is the social code-sharing platform, GitHub.
</p>
<p>
GitHub is a website where users can upload their code either directly, or by "pushing" or making pull requests to send their code from their terminal using the software git (discussed above) in order to collaborate with other people or have people review and comment on their projects. GitHub is a useful website because it allows collaborators to work on a project remotely, from different locations, and then push or pull their changes to github.com so that their changes or requests for changes are viewable by other people working on the project. GitHub also promotes the idea of Open Source code and code-sharing which endorses creativity and increased learning in the coding community.
</p>
<p>
Well, I hope that I did not butcher any of these topics too much, and that someone can find my explanations helpful or useful in some way! Wish me luck for the next week of my coding adventure!

  <h3>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h3>
  <h4>December 12, 2014</h4>
      <p>
        Shereef's Fireside Chat enforced the fact that DBC is largely what one makes of it, which I find both very exciting and a bit nerve-racking. I am really excited to be in such a creative and experimental learning environment, but worried about maintaining motivation when things get tough. I feel confident that DBC's system of continuous feedback and meta feedback will be helpful in this arena, though. </p>
        <p>
One of the first things that attracted me to DBC was the culture. I completely agreed with the sentiments in the Engineering Empathy video, and as a strong proponent of a daily mindful meditation practice, I really appreciate that DBC cares a lot about not only helping people become great software engineers, but also better and more present people in the process. Another aspect of the DBC culture and attitude that I really respect and am happy to be a part of is the attitude towards learning. I was extremely excited when I saw the suggested reading materials about reteaching yourself to learn more effectively in the Phase 0 prep period, and have been reading and loving the book A Mind for Numbers which seems to embody DBC's attitude that a fixed mindset and narrow, static view of one's own abilities and intellect is the most harmful perspective a person can have in regards to overall self-betterment. Over the last few years, I have become increasingly aware of how much life requires putting in the amount of effort and hard work that you want the equivalent level of reward and success from in return. This seemingly obvious realization has led me to become fascinated with the self-help realm that is focused on rewiring your brain and clearing your head in order to perform at your highest level of capability.
