        <p>
          Pair Programming is a process two people working collaboratively on a project with one person driving and the other navigating which we will discuss in a later section.
          It requires people to express themselves clearly, and can work to test their knowledge of the material.
          It allows each person to focus on a different aspect of the project and reduces the context switching penalty they would otherwise experience.
          It also allows for the easy sharing of knowledge between the two people and promotes symbiotic learning.
