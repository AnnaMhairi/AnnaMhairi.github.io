      Shereef's Fireside Chat enforced the fact that DBC is largely what one makes of it, which I find both very exciting and a bit nerve-racking. I am really excited to be in such a creative and experimental learning environment, but worried about maintaining motivation when things get tough. I feel confident that DBC's system of continuous feedback and meta feedback will be helpful in this arena, though.

        One of the first things that attracted me to DBC was the culture. I completely agreed with the sentiments in the Engineering Empathy video, and as a strong proponent of a daily mindful meditation practice, I really appreciate that DBC cares a lot about not only helping people become great software engineers, but also better and more present people in the process. Another aspect of the DBC culture and attitude that I really respect and am happy to be a part of is the attitude towards learning. I was extremely excited when I saw the suggested reading materials about reteaching yourself to learn more effectively in the Phase 0 prep period, and have been reading and loving the book A Mind for Numbers which seems to embody DBC's attitude that a fixed mindset and narrow, static view of one's own abilities and intellect is the most harmful perspective a person can have in regards to overall self-betterment. Over the last few years, I have become increasingly aware of how much life requires putting in the amount of effort and hard work that you want the equivalent level of reward and success from in return. This seemingly obvious realization has led me to become fascinated with the self-help realm that is focused on rewiring your brain and clearing your head in order to perform at your highest level of capability.
