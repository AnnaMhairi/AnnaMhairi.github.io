  <h3>What is Rails?</h3>
  <h4>February 14, 2015</h4>
  <p>
    Rails is a web application framework which is written in the language Ruby. It is a full-stack framework - meaning that the framework can be used from the user interface until the data storage.
</p>
<p>
  Rails was designed using very firm principles, including Convention over Configuration (CoC) and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). Convention over configuration means that aspects of the application only need to be specified if they stray from the Ruby on Rails convention in some way. Don't Repeat Yourself means that code should not be repeated throughout a program unless it is absolutely necessary. This principle encourages looping and storing information in variables for easier access.
</p>
<p>
  Rails has been criticized for issues with its scalability, but is mostly regarded as a very developer-friendly framework with its use of the simple language, Ruby. It is used to run huge sites such as Hulu, Scribd and GitHub.
