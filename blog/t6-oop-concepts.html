  <h3>Ruby Classes v. Modules</h3>
  <h4>February 1, 2015</h4>
  <p>
    Modules and Classes are very similar Ruby constructs, but each have their own unique benefits. Modules are often described as the larger, more basic constructs that act similarly to a superclass (a class that another class inherits information from in the class hierarchy). Classes, on the other hand, have the ability to create instances of themselves (Class objects or instances), so are generally quite complex and more specific constructs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modules are great for design purposes because they "encourage modular design: program design that breaks large components into smaller ones and lets you mix and match object behaviors" (Black, 287). A limitation of modules is that they are not used to create objects directly - instead, they are largely mixed into a class or multiple class so that the methods included in the module can be used in the class object(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    Ruby classes are more powerful constructs in the sense that they are able to create class objects or instances, but they still are lower in the inheritance ranking than modules - with the module acting like the superclass of any given class. This is a helpful setup because modules are able to be included in multiple classes (using the 'include' method), whereas classes can only inherit from one given superclass at any time. This is helpful for separating classes adequately specifically, while still allowing for the easy assignment of various methods to multiple classes using modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Classes and modules can seem very similar to a newcomer to Ruby, but they are actually useful in completley different ways. A solid understanding of classes and modules is crucial to becoming a programmer who follows the best design practices.
