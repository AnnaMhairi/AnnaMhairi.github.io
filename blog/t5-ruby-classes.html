  <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
  <h4>January 25, 2015</h4>
      <p>
        Classes are an extremely important Ruby topic since they allow the bundling of related information - including methods and variables, instance variables, that are able to cross over methods within a certain class.
</p>
<p> Here is an example of when using Ruby classes is helpful:
  </p>
  <p>
    class Person [used to represent multiple people]
      def initialize [initialize these variables]
        @name = name
        @age = age
        @gender = gender
      end
      def describe_person
        puts "This person's name is #{@name}, their age is #{@age}, and they are #{gender}."
      end
    end
  </p>
  <p>
    This class is used to describe different people and is useful because it allows you to create a new instance of that class and specify certain descriptions of people and return describe_people for many different people. It could potentially be used for describing different people in a roster, such as an employment roster - saving time for the programmer of defining each person from scratch.
