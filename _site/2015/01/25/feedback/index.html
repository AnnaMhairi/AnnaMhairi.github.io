  <p>Pair coding has been an interesting experience in DBC so far. I am definitely more of a private, individual learner, so it has been pretty challenging for me to work on solving challenges with other people. I also am better at formulating my thoughts when I write them down, so that has also been tough since I am not always ‘driving’ while pair coding. I think it is very rewarding to solve a challenge with your pair when your ideas come together; however, there have also been many moments of frustration when neither pair can come up with any sort of solution to the current problem. I have also experienced some frustration when I am working with someone more advanced at a certain topic, and I am not understanding the problem.</p>

<p>It has felt pretty good to read my feedback, since it has all been positive so far. I don’t think any of it has been very helpful yet because I haven’t received a lot of constructive criticism - but I think that will come as I pair more. I have learned something from writing my feedback to other people, though, because I have noticed that I always stress that we should review the challenge we will be working on prior to pairing, and that is my fault as well as my pair’s. The most challenging thing for me when writing feedback for others has been coming up with feedback that is both specific and actionable. A lot of the time, I am still concerned with not offending anyone, since we are all still struggling and learning.</p>
