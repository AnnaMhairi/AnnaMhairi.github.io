    <p>I am not a big question asker. This is definitely an area I need to improve in, since the programming community seems to be very question-oriented. I think most of the time, I would rather struggle with the answer myself until I have absolutely no possible solution, and then research the exact problem I am having - which is usually answered somewhere on Stack Overflow. So, although I do not have a lot of direct experience writing good questions, I feel able to quickly recognize good or bad questions due to spending a lot of time researching very specific solutions to questions that I would like answered.</p>

<p>I think specificity is the cornerstone of asking a good question, and most importantly, specificity in the title. A lot of the time I will research titles very quickly until I find one matching my exact query. Noting the language the question is referring to in the title is also crucial. As for the body of the question, as a newcomer to programming, I find the most useful answers to have a quick excerpt regarding the issue they are having and then a simple code snippet that does not require too much external information or references. Sometimes while researching on Stack Overflow, I have been overwhelemd by the code excerpts that people post in their question, and end up leaving to another page simply because I think the question involves a more complex topic than the one I am having problems with. This may be unrelatable since I am new to programming, but I think that good questions should avoid being overly complex or lofty because that makes them easier to answer (if they are still specific enough).</p>

<p>Well, that’s it for my musings on how to write a good question (from a non question-asker’s perspective). Feel free to tweet at me (@annamhairi) if you have any feedback or responses! Happy question asking!</p>
