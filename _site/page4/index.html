        Stereotype Threat

    <p>My experience transitioning into becoming a programmer has been my biggest exposure to stereotype threat so far because I am a woman who comes from a non-technical background and has had bad experiences with math in the past. Although most of these feelings have been self-imposed, I have felt more embarrassed than usual in certain pairing sessions with men if I can’t come up with the correct solution, and feel a lot of the time like I have to prove myself more to be considered at the same level as a man.</p>

<p>I have found so far that the best way to combat these feelings when they come up is by focusing on acting professional and letting go of my ego or focus on ‘self’ and trying to hope that my partner is doing the same. I have also started to really appreciate partners who are more knowledgeable than I am - even if they are men - because they can offer a great learning experience and help me improve. Looking at this type of an experience as helpful instead of threatening or condescending is a very useful point of view shift.</p>

<p>If I sense that somebody else in experiencing stereotype threat, I will try to be as neutral and professional as possible because I think that type of attitude always helps people feel more comfortable and like they are taken more seriously. If I ever have to explain a concept to a pair that they don’t understand, I will focus on checking along the way to make sure that I am not sounding condescending or explaining something that they already know. Answering this question in the public setting is much more difficult, but I try to treat everybody equally and foster a welcoming vibe that doesn’t discriminate, so I think that is the best way I can help peope in general feel more comfortable.</p>
