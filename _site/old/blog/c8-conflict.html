  <h3>Conflict</h3>
  <h4>February 14, 2015</h4>
  <p>
    A time I have had conflict is when my best friend wants to go out late on the weekends like we used to before I became serious with my boyfriend when I don't see the same value in those types of nights anymore. These types of situations make me feel extremely guilty, and like I am being a bad friend - even if I make (what I see as) reasonable conflicts. This type of guilt has led me to resent her at times in these situations because I feel as though her interpretation of the situation is wrong and unfair.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to try and be as honest as possible in this situation and explain that I would be doing certain activities with her just to make her feel better, and that I think it's unfair to be guilted about how I want to spend my time. I think if I could go back, I would explain this to her earlier and not go out with her just to appease her because I think she would ultimately understand that I don't enjoy the same activities as much anymore, but that I still appreciate spending time with her in a different way. I think if I had been upfront and established this type of communication earlier on, I could have prevented a lot of uncomfortable times for both of us.
</p>
<p>
  This conflict was a good example of being able to identify the source of feelings of resentment as an underlying guilt. I think the resentment was largely caused by doing things that I did not want to do to please others, which I think I will be more careful about in the future.
